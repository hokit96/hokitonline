					<p>
						<b>How do I make a change to my order?</b> <a>Please be advised that once your order has been confirmed you can no longer make any changes to your order. Typically you can only make a change to your order within 24 hours by contact us directly.
If your order has not yet been shipped, please contact us to notify us of your change request, or call us at 03-9056 2217 or 016-3323 771 and we will be happy to assist you.</a>
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>How can I cancel my order?</b>
						<a>Please be advised that you can only cancel your order if it has not yet been shipped out.

If you have received an email stating that your order has already been shipped, the only way to cancel your order would be to refuse the package upon delivery. When the store receives the package returned and unopened, they will request the amount be credited back to the credit card you used to place the original purchase. Your shipping charges will not be credited.

If your order has not yet been shipped out, please send us an email by using the contact us form and selecting the subject line Cancel Order. This will help us better track your email inquiry and ensure you will get a quicker response to your cancellation request.</a>
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>How will I know when my order is shipped?</b>
						<a>You will be notified by a series of emails indicating when your order was received, shipped, backordered, or cancelled, provided that an accurate email address was given.</a>
											</p>
					<p>
						<b>How do I return or exchange an item?</b>
						All refunds and exchanges must be completed within 30 days from the day your order is shipped.

					</p>

                        How long does it take to process orders?</b>
                        If we receive your order by 1:00am, it will be processed and shipped the same day, provided we have the item in stock. Due to the high volume of orders we receive during the specific seasons, please be advised that our policy allows up to 1-3 business days before your order may be shipped out.
